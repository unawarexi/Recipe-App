# React Native Navigation

## Introduction
React Native Navigation is crucial for building complex mobile applications with multiple screens. It allows users to navigate between different parts of the application smoothly and efficiently. 
There are several navigation libraries available for React Native, each with its own set of features and benefits.

## Key Concepts
1. **Screen Components**: Each screen in your application is represented by a React component. These components define the UI and functionality of the screen.

2. **Navigation Stack**: Navigation stack manages the order of screens in your application. When you navigate to a new screen, it gets added to the navigation stack, and when you go back, screens are removed from the stack.

3. **Navigation Options**: Navigation options allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of each screen in the navigation stack. This includes options like screen title, header style, and gestures.

4. **Navigator**: Navigator is a component that manages the navigation stack and provides methods for navigating between screens. Different navigation libraries offer different types of navigators, such as Stack Navigator, Tab Navigator, Drawer Navigator, etc.

## Popular Navigation Libraries
1. **React Navigation**: A popular and widely-used navigation library for React Native. It offers a flexible and easy-to-use API with support for various navigation patterns.

2. **React Native Navigation**: A highly performant navigation library developed by Wix. It provides native navigation solutions for both iOS and Android platforms, resulting in smoother transitions and better user experience.

3. **React Native Router**: Another navigation library inspired by React Router. It offers a simple and declarative API for defining routes and handling navigation in your application.

## Getting Started
To get started with React Native navigation, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the navigation library of your choice using npm or yarn.
2. Set up the navigation configuration in your main application file (e.g., App.js).
3. Define screen components for each screen in your application.
4. Configure navigation options for each screen to customize their appearance and behavior.
5. Implement navigation logic using navigation methods provided by the navigation library (e.g., navigate, goBack, push, pop, etc.).
